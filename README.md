I work at [Cepheid](https://www.cepheid.com/) (Stockholm, Sweden) as a Software Engineer. Worked at [Expleo](https://expleo.com/global/en/) (Stockholm, Sweden). Studied java development at [Nackademin](https://nackademin.se/).

As part of my work at Cepheid, I like to explore different technologies. I mostly do Java, Javascript, TypeScript  (order of preference).
